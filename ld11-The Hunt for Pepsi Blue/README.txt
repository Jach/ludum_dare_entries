the Pepsi trademark, and all occurrances should probably have a tm or
a r with a circle or something next to them.

Running the game:
python run_game.py

Cheats:
press i in-game to make your life go back to 100
press s in-game to reduce people left to 0

Theme-arguments:
Used only KolourPaint for graphics, and only the colors that are loaded when
you first start it.
Used Python. =P
All sounds made with mic or by sfxr or by Hydrogen drum thing.
The ending is minimal. Just prints out you win or you lose.
Used vi to write everything...
I'm just making stuff up now.
