PepsiCo. is doing a national tour of the
discontinued Pepsi Blue! And they've    
announced that after everyone who shows 
up to the events gets one bottle,       
whoever is left can fight over the      
remaining cases. Thus in order to       
maximize your stock of perhaps the last 
batch of Pepsi Blue produced, you must  
minimize the competition.               
Keep people out of the parking lots!    
Use your trusty tank to blow them up    
with the space bar or ram them away     
with the arrow keys--though be careful, 
ramming does hurt your tank. The pink   
eco-cars shouldn't be a problem, and    
you can get away with attacking the     
aqua vans... But beware the yellow      
buses!
