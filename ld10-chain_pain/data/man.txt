You volunteered to do a test of manliness
in which two dungeon masters are allowed
to whip you with chains.
The goal is to show no reaction,
by keeping the little blue bar around
the green area for as long as possible
with the two arrow keys on the keyboard.
If you cry, you lose one of your two
manlinesses, and will be laughed at.
